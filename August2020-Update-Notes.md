## Module 2

Changed from 7 clips to 10 clips.  Significantly improved explanations and demos.  useEffect is not gone into much more in depth with better explanations.
The scrolling and colorizing component has been re-written to be much simpler and more instructive.

## Module 3

Same number of clips with same titles.  Much improved coding examples and enhanced explanations.

## Module 4

Same number of clips and very few changes.

## Module 5

Changed from 6 to 8 clips.  Completely re-worked REST example and custom hook to be written from the ground up with no cutting
and pasting. Same with the reducer code. This is much easier to follow and code along now.

## Module 6

This module is 100% new and replaces the previous module on authentication.  **Global App State With useContext and useReducer Like Redux**
